## Migration Notes

### From Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions

If migrating from the Azure DevOps pipelines to GitHub Actions:

1. **Backup existing state**: Ensure Terraform state is backed up
2. **Create GitHub secrets**: Follow the [setup guide](./GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)
3. **Test in dev environment**: Validate deployment before production
4. **Update variables**: Check `terraform.tfvars` files for environment-specific values
5. **Configure environments**: Set up GitHub environment protection rules

### Breaking Changes

- **Directory Structure**: Project restructured from `lessons/day26/` to `infrastructure/` 
- **Service Principal**: New SP required for GitHub Actions (separate from Azure DevOps)
- **Backend configuration**: Updated to use dynamic backend configuration
- **Variable names**: Standardized variable naming conventions
- **Workflow paths**: GitHub Actions workflows updated for new directory structure

### Migration Guide

If upgrading from the old structure:

1. **Backup your state**: Ensure all Terraform state files are backed up
2. **Update local clones**: Re-clone repository or manually update directory references
3. **Update CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows automatically updated
4. **Review configurations**: Check `terraform.tfvars` files in new environment directories
5. **Test deployments**: Validate in development environment first
